    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>This magazine cover features a minimalist, fashion-forward layout inspired 
        by high-end magazines like Vogue. The design highlights a modern model with 
        clean typography, neutral tones, and refined subheadlines to match the theme 
        “the new face of minimal beauty.” Photoshop tools were used to blend the 
        background, adjust tones, and create a polished, professional look.

    <h2>Explanation of tools and skills</h2>
    <p>For this magazine cover, I used the Type Tool to add the title and headlines, 
        and the Select Subject and Select and Mask tools with Smart Radius to isolate 
        the model and refine hair edges. I mirrored the model by flipping the image 
        horizontally and applied Neural Filter – Skin Smoothing for a polished editorial 
        look. I adjusted colors using Hue/Saturation and Color Balance adjustment layers, 
        added Drop Shadows and feathered edges with Layer Masks to blend the model 
        naturally into the background, and used an Overlay layer with a soft brush to 
        simulate reflected light. Finally, I applied a Gaussian Blur to the background 
        for depth and added a low-opacity barcode to maintain a clean, cohesive layout, 
        demonstrating proficiency in image masking, retouching, color correction, and 
        composition.
