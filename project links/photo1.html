<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>For this project, I created a branding package for Luna & Leaf, a fictional eco-friendly skincare
brand. My goal was to design a clean, nature-inspired aesthetic that reflects the brandâ€™s natural
and gentle qualities. This package includes a custom logo, business card (front and back), and a
promotional banner. Throughout the process, I applied a wide range of Photoshop tools and
techniques to show both my technical skills and creative decision-making.</p>
<h2>Explanation of tools and skills</h2>
<p>I used the Ellipse and Pen Tools to create precise shapes and flowing, organic forms, while 
    Smart Objects allowed me to edit images non-destructively. I applied Adjustment Layers and 
    Hue/Saturation adjustments to match colors across elements, and used layer styles, shadows, 
    and overlays to add depth and dimension. I isolated images and vectors for precise placement, 
    manually applied highlights and shadows to enhance detail, and carefully aligned text and 
    elements to ensure balance, readability, and a cohesive, professional brand aesthetic.
