<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to create a digital advertisement for a skincare 
  brand using Adobe Animate. The goal was to design an engaging and visually appealing 
  animation that effectively communicates the brand’s values while promoting its products. 
  This project focused on combining graphic design elements, motion, and timing to capture 
  the viewer’s attention and deliver a clear message. By using animation, the ad aimed to 
  highlight the eco-friendly and modern qualities of the brand.

<h2>Explanation of tools and skills</h2>
<p>For this project, I started by importing the background, the woman’s face, and the 
  wind vector into separate layers on the stage so I could animate each one individually. 
  I created motion tweens for the wind, which made it look like a gust blowing the woman away. 
  To add more detail, I imported a dust image and set the blend mode to darken so parts of 
  the dust would be transparent and look more natural in the scene. I also added a glow around 
  the product to make it stand out and gave the product a motion tween so it slid into the stage 
  when it appeared. To bring more impact to that moment, I added a sound effect that plays as the 
  product and glow show up, and I layered in background music to tie the whole animation together. 
  By combining layers, motion tweens, blend modes, effects, and audio, I was able to create a more 
  dynamic and engaging ad.
