<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The purpose of this project was to practice creating an original animation in Adobe 
  Animate while learning how to use the program’s tools and techniques effectively. By 
  designing a character and placing her in a scene with a background, I was able to apply 
  key skills such as working with shapes, converting artwork into symbols, and animating 
  movement through frame-by-frame techniques. This project also allowed me to experiment 
  with different animation methods, such as motion tweens and parenting, before deciding 
  on the approach that worked best. The goal was not only to complete a short animation 
  but also to build a deeper understanding of the software.</p>
<h2>Explanation of tools and skills</h2>
<p>For my Adobe Animate project, I created a short animation featuring a girl character 
  on a background. To build the character, I used basic vector drawing tools in Animate, 
  such as the Oval, Rectangle, and Brush tools, combining and reshaping them to form her 
  body, head, arms, and other details. Working with shapes and fills allowed me to layer 
  and adjust her parts so they looked like one cohesive figure.
  Once the main artwork was finished, I converted parts of the girl into symbols (like 
  arms or the body) so that I could move and animate them more easily without redrawing. 
  Using symbols also helped keep the project organized in the Library.
  For the animation process, I first experimented with the parenting technique and motion 
  tweens to animate the girl’s arm. However, I ran into some trouble making the movements 
  look natural, so I decided to switch to frame-by-frame animation instead. This gave me 
  more direct control over each pose and made the motion feel smoother. The background came 
  from Animate’s built-in assets, which I imported onto the stage and arranged behind the girl.
