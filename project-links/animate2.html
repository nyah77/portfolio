<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>This project creates an interactive door animation in Adobe Animate that opens on 
  mouse-over to reveal a design in the background. It demonstrates skills in timeline 
  control, classic tweening, symbol creation, and ActionScript coding, combining animation 
  and interactivity into a visually engaging project.
</p>
<h2>Explanation of tools and skills</h2>
<p>For this project, I used Adobe Animate and ActionScript 3.0 to create an interactive 
  door animation. I began by importing images of the left and right doors into the library 
  and aligning them on the stage. I then selected both doors and converted them into a single 
  symbol called “doors.” Inside the doors timeline, I converted each door into a separate 
  movie clip symbol and created individual layers so each door could be animated independently. 
  I inserted keyframes up to frame 20 for both layers and moved each door outside the stage at 
  frame 20. Using classic tweens, I created a smooth sliding animation to make it appear as though 
  the doors were opening. To control the animation, I added a “Stop at this frame” action to the 
  first frame so it would not loop automatically. I set instance names for the left and right 
  doors and added mouse-over events for each, triggering the doors to open when hovered over. 
  Since the animation was initially too short, I extended the keyframes to frame 40 and applied 
  another “Stop at this frame” action to ensure the doors would stop in the open position. Finally, 
  I added a scenic background so that it would be revealed when the doors opened. This project 
  demonstrates skills in timeline management, symbol creation, classic tweening, ActionScript 
  coding, and interactive animation design.
