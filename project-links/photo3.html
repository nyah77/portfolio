    <h1>Photoshop project 3</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to practice advanced photo restoration 
        techniques in Photoshop, transforming a damaged or faded image into a 
        clearer and more visually appealing version. This exercise focused on 
        preserving the original photograph’s historical and sentimental value 
        while improving its overall quality. By restoring the image, the project 
        demonstrated how digital tools can be used to extend the life of old 
        photographs and make them more meaningful for modern viewing.
    </p>
    <h2>Explanation of tools and skills</h2>
    <p>For this project, I used the Spot Healing Brush Tool and Healing Brush Tool 
        to remove scratches, water spots, and blemishes while preserving natural 
        textures. I converted the image to a Smart Object to enable non-destructive
        editing and applied the Neural Filter – Colorize for initial colorization. 
        To refine the AI-generated color, I manually painted in missing or inaccurate 
        areas using sampled colors and created precise selections with the Magnetic 
        Lasso Tool to adjust the bricks around the fireplace. I then used Hue/Saturation 
        adjustment layers to fine-tune color, saturation, and brightness. Throughout the 
        process, I revisited healing and retouching tools to ensure a clean, polished 
        result, demonstrating careful attention to detail and mastery of both AI-assisted 
        and manual editing techniques.</p>
