    <h1>Typography Explained</h1>
    <p>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language 
      legible, readable, and visually appealing. It includes the selection of typefaces, 
      point size, line length, line spacing, and letter spacing, as well as the adjustment 
      of space between pairs of letters. </p>
