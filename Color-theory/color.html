    <h1>Color Theory Explained</h1>
    <p>Color Theory is the study of how colors interact, mix and influence one another. 
      It helps artists and designers understand how to use color to create harmony,<br> balance, 
      and emotion in their work. By learning color theory, we can make visual choices that 
      grab attention and communicate meaning effectively.</p>
