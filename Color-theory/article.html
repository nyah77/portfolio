    <h1>The Power of Color in Web Design</h1>
    <p>Color plays a powerful role in how users perceive a website and brand. 
  Two companies that demonstrate this perfectly are <strong>Glossier</strong> and 
  <strong>Tesla</strong>. Both brands use minimalist layouts and high-quality imagery, 
  yet their color choices lead to entirely different emotional experiences. Glossier’s 
  soft, pastel palette creates a calm and inviting feel, while Tesla’s sleek monochrome 
  design communicates innovation and luxury.</p>

  <h2>Glossier: Softness and Simplicity</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.glossier.com">Visit Glossier</a></p>
  <img src="../images/Gloss.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Glossier homepage" width="400">
<p>Glossier’s website reflects the brand’s modern and youthful image through its use of 
  <strong>soft pinks, creams, and white backgrounds</strong>. The design feels airy and 
  approachable, with plenty of white space that highlights product images. The color palette 
  supports Glossier’s identity as a brand focused on natural beauty and self-expression. 
  Rather than overwhelming users, the gentle colors and minimal typography create a sense 
  of calm and trust.</p>

  <h2>Tesla: Sleek and Futuristic</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.tesla.com" target="_blank">Visit Tesla</a></p>
  <img src="../images/Tesla.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Tesla homepage" width="400">

  <p>Tesla’s website takes a completely different approach. It uses 
  <strong>black, white, and gray tones</strong> with bold photography of vehicles and 
  technology. This stark contrast emphasizes precision, performance, and high-end 
  sophistication. The lack of color works in Tesla’s favor — it allows the sleek 
  car designs and red logo to stand out. The overall effect is modern, confident, 
  and innovative.</p>

  <h2>Comparison: Two Minimalist Styles, Two Different Feelings</h2>
  <p>Both Glossier and Tesla rely on minimalist layouts, but color is what sets 
    their tones apart. Glossier’s soft hues make the brand feel <strong>warm and 
    personal</strong>, appealing to emotion and self-care. esla’s grayscale tones 
    create a <strong>bold and futuristic</strong> atmosphere, emphasizing innovation 
    and status. The difference in color use shows how design choices can shape brand
    perception — even when layouts are simple.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Through color alone, Glossier and Tesla show that minimalism doesn’t mean uniformity. 
  Glossier’s pastel design invites users in with warmth and approachability, 
  while Tesla’s monochrome style commands attention through sleek sophistication. 
  Both websites prove that color is not just decoration — it’s an essential tool for 
  storytelling and brand identity.</p>
